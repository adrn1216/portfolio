      "Adrian aka Louis was great to work with, third time I have used him. I had lots of additional requests and he had completed the video in 3 days, but I was very busy with my personal work life, so I asked if he could edit more at a later date. He was happy to accommodate this and always pleased to put his customers' first.\n\nWould 100% recommend, you can't go wrong with him in my opinion.",

      "The products he delivered are of great quality and he understands exactly what we need. If we have feedback he delivers that feedback on point and with his own creativity if need be. This time I ordered two trailers at the same time, previously I already had one. So he brings consistent quality. \n\nHe did have too many projects running at the same time this time. But he solved that professionally and kept us up to date accordingly!",
